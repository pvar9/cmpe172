The purpose of this project is to connect employees within a company. 
Typically, LinkedIn and mutual friends are the primary ways for employees to expand their network. 
However, there are many employees who do not have a LinkedIn. 
This can be difficult for employees and especially new hires who are trying to connect with others and broaden their network.
LinkMe provides a solution to this issue by giving employees the opportunity to gain insight on other’s work and contributions within the company. 
From changing departments to different roles within a team, LinkMe keeps track of employee’s job history.
Employees can learn about one another, recommend members of similar experience to work together, and influence an internal network of familiarity within the company. 
This not only does LinkMe provide a way for employees to expand their network but also improve the work culture from within.
